- Uses big emoji buttons for your choices
- Tracks your score and the computer's score
- Has Play Again and Reset Score buttons
- Looks great on any device with a green and purple theme
- Gives instant feedback after each round

## How to play
1. Click an emoji to pick rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer picks its choice and you see who wins.
3. Click Play Again to keep playing.
4. Click Reset Score to start over.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Why I made it this way
- Bright colors and big buttons make it easy and fun
- Scoreboard and title are easy to see
- All the game logic is handled in JavaScript

## Possible upgrades
